# Codegen documentation

## Example usage

From command line:

* **entity Book generate crud** - generates of CRUD (create/read/update/delete) code for whole, existing Book entity, 
* **generate entity Book** - generates empty Book entity,
* **entity Book generate property text username** - generates property username inside entity Book,

## Integration tests

There should be list of usages (set of commands) and application that should be generated with them. 

Every integration test should generate new application and compare it with the existing one
